Net_Set is a simple, open-source network hardening and diagnostics tool for Android.

It provides a minimal status screen and a set of connectivity checks to help you validate your network environment:

• IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity tests
• DNS resolution tests (with selectable resolvers)
• Encrypted DNS (DNS-over-HTTPS) reachability checks

Where supported by your device, Net_Set can also run the bundled Net_Set scripts to apply network configuration changes. Some operations may require root access.

Privacy:
Net_Set does not collect data, does not run analytics, and does not include ads.
