# Fastlane metadata

This directory contains Google Play listing metadata in the standard fastlane structure:

- `android/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`

You can use this with fastlane `supply` if you want to automate Play Store uploads.

Note:
- Screenshots are not included in the repository; add them under `images/phoneScreenshots/`.
- Actual Play submission still requires a Play Console account and an uploaded, signed AAB.
