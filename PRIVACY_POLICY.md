# Net_Set Android — Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-12-14

Net_Set is an open-source Android app that provides a simple UI for running local network diagnostics and (where supported by the device) local network-hardening scripts.

## Summary

- Net_Set **does not collect, store, or sell** personal data.
- Net_Set **does not use analytics**, advertising SDKs, or crash reporting SDKs.
- Net_Set runs diagnostics locally and shows results on-screen. Any output is stored **only on your device**.

## Data Collection

Net_Set **does not collect**:

- Name, email address, or contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers (Advertising ID, IMEI, etc.)
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Crash reports

## Network Access

Net_Set requests the `INTERNET` permission to perform network diagnostics (e.g., ping, DNS lookup, HTTPS requests) and to test encrypted DNS endpoints.

The app may connect to third-party endpoints (for example, DNS resolver test domains and DNS-over-HTTPS URLs) **only when you trigger diagnostics**, or when scripts you run initiate those connections.

## Data Storage

Net_Set may store:

- Script output and diagnostic results **locally** (app-private storage)

This information is not transmitted to the developer.

## Children’s Privacy

Net_Set is not directed to children, and it does not knowingly collect personal information.

## Changes

If this policy changes, updates will be published in this repository.
